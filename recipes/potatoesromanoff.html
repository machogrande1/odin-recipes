    <h3>Potatoes Romanoff is a rich, decadent steakhouse side dish</h3>
    <p>Baked potatoes are shredded and combined with cheese, 
        sour cream, shallots, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper 
        to make this incredibly creamy and satisfying recipe.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced shallots</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Poke holes into potatoes using a knife. 
            Wrap each potato in aluminum foil and 
            place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are 
            very tender and easily pierced with a knife, 
            about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let potatoes cool to room temperature. 
            Unwrap and place on a plate. Cover with 
            plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely 
            chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
            Butter a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Leave skin on potatoes. Use a cheese grater to 
            shred potatoes into a large bowl. Add shallots
             to potatoes; season with salt, white pepper, 
             and cayenne. Toss with two forks until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and mix well. Gently toss in 
            sour cream until barely combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish, piling 
            it up high, then patting it down very lightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and 
            the top is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
